<h1>My Own Functions</h1>
<p> 
<font size = '32'>
In order to understand functional programming in R, I have started to create basic functions from scratch.
Most exist in the vanilla version of R, and some in various packages. However, I did not look for these documentations
while creating these functions, and only used the functional programming section of the Advanced R book by Hadley Wickham
published by CRC Press.
